# Image Edge Detection and Cropping

## Project Overview

This repository contains a JavaFX application for **image edge detection and cropping**. The project is designed to process images, identify significant edges within them, and can also crop the images based on configurations. It serves as a practical tool for image preprocessing, suitable for tasks in computer vision, and image cropping.

## Features

- **Edge Detection:** Utilizes algorithms to detect edges in input images.
- **Automatic Cropping:** Crops images based on configured paramters or crop rectangle.
- **Java Implementation:** Entirely written in Java for portability and performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Libraries:** JavaFX
